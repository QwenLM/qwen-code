# Qwen Code Electron Desktop Implementation Plan

This plan tracks the incremental MVP implementation for the Electron desktop
client described in
`docs/design/qwen-code-electron-desktop/qwen-code-electron-desktop-architecture.md`.
The architecture document remains the source of truth; this file records
execution order, verification, decisions, and remaining work.

## Ground Rules

- Use Electron only; do not introduce Tauri.
- Keep Electron main thin: windows, native IPC, local server lifecycle, and ACP
  process lifecycle.
- Reuse Qwen Code ACP, core configuration/auth/session/permission behavior, and
  shared web UI surfaces where practical.
- Renderer must use `nodeIntegration: false`, context isolation, and a preload
  whitelist.
- The local server must bind only `127.0.0.1`, use a random token, and reject
  unauthorized requests.
- Every completed slice must leave targeted verification and a conventional
  commit.

## Task Breakdown
