# Qwen Code Electron Desktop Implementation Plan

This plan tracks the incremental MVP implementation for the Electron desktop
client described in
`docs/design/qwen-code-electron-desktop/qwen-code-electron-desktop-architecture.md`.
The architecture document remains the source of truth; this file records
execution order, verification, decisions, and remaining work.

## Ground Rules

- Use Electron only; do not introduce Tauri.
- Keep Electron main thin: windows, native IPC, local server lifecycle, and ACP
  process lifecycle.
- Reuse Qwen Code ACP, core configuration/auth/session/permission behavior, and
  shared web UI surfaces where practical.
- Renderer must use `nodeIntegration: false`, context isolation, and a preload
  whitelist.
- The local server must bind only `127.0.0.1`, use a random token, and reject
  unauthorized requests.
- Every completed slice must leave targeted verification and a conventional
  commit.

## Codex Alignment Progress

### Active Slice: Review Drawer and Compact Topbar Alignment

Status: completed in iteration 3.

Goal: make review a supporting drawer that opens beside the conversation, and
replace the heavy topbar tabs with compact icon-led workbench actions.

User-visible value: the first viewport keeps the conversation as the main
workspace while still exposing changed files, settings, Git refresh, and status
from a slim topbar that better matches `home.jpg`.

Expected files:

- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/TopBar.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/ReviewPanel.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/SidebarIcons.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`
- `packages/desktop/scripts/e2e-cdp-smoke.mjs`
- `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/review-drawer-topbar.md`

Acceptance criteria:

- Opening Changes renders `ChatThread` and `ReviewPanel` together; review no
  longer replaces the conversation.
- The default first viewport has no review drawer, and the conversation spans
  the workbench.
- Topbar action controls are compact icon buttons with accessible labels and
  tooltips; the previous Chat/Changes/Settings segmented text tabs are removed.
- The topbar title remains the active thread/project identity instead of
  changing to `Changes` when review opens.
- Settings still opens as a full workbench page and hides the terminal.
- Existing review actions, comments, staging, and commit workflow keep working.

Verification:

- Unit/component test command:
  `cd packages/desktop && SHELL=/bin/bash npx vitest run src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- Build/typecheck/lint commands:
  `cd packages/desktop && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build`
- Real Electron harness:
  `cd packages/desktop && npm run e2e:cdp`
- Harness path: `packages/desktop/scripts/e2e-cdp-smoke.mjs`
- E2E scenario steps: launch real Electron with isolated HOME/runtime/user-data
  and fake ACP, open the fake Git project, send from the project composer,
  approve the fake command, open Changes from the compact topbar action, review
  and comment on the README diff while chat remains mounted, stage all changes,
  commit, return to chat, open settings, and run terminal paths.
- E2E assertions: default layout has no review drawer; opening Changes creates
  a drawer without unmounting chat; drawer width stays supporting rather than
  dominant; topbar has compact action buttons; console errors and failed local
  requests are absent.
- Diagnostic artifacts: CDP screenshots, layout JSON, DOM text, Electron log,
  summary JSON under `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/artifacts/`.
- Required skills applied: `frontend-design` for prototype-constrained topbar
  density and drawer hierarchy; `electron-desktop-dev` for renderer changes and
  real Electron CDP verification.

Notes and decisions:

- This slice deliberately keeps Settings as a full page because that behavior
  was already implemented and verified; only review moves into the supporting
  drawer pattern.
- The review drawer remains closed by default to preserve the first viewport
  emphasis from `home.jpg`; Git dirty count and the Changes action are the
  visible entry points.
- `frontend-design` guidance is applied with the project prompt constraint that
  the prototype wins: compact utility controls, restrained borders, and no new
  decorative art direction.

Verification results:

- `cd packages/desktop && SHELL=/bin/bash npx vitest run src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
  passed with 4 tests.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run typecheck` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run lint` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run build` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run e2e:cdp` passed after launch through real
  Electron over CDP.
- Passing artifacts:
  `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/artifacts/2026-04-25T16-51-33-353Z/`.

Next work:

- Improve review terminology and safety by replacing `Accept`/`Revert` with
  Stage/Unstage/Discard language and adding confirmations for destructive
  discard paths.
- Collapse the terminal into a status strip by default so the first viewport
  gets closer to `home.jpg`.

### Completed Slice: Composer-First Thread Creation Alignment

Status: completed in iteration 2.

Goal: let a user open a project and type immediately, without first learning
that they must create or select a session.

User-visible value: the default path becomes
`Open project -> type request -> agent works`; the composer explains the active
project context and creates the backing desktop session on first send.

Expected files:

- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/App.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/ChatThread.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`
- `packages/desktop/scripts/e2e-cdp-smoke.mjs`
- `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/composer-first-thread-creation.md`

Acceptance criteria:

- Composer is enabled whenever a project is active, even when no session is
  selected.
- With no project, composer remains disabled and gives a clear disabled reason.
- First send from a project with no selected session creates a desktop session,
  sends the message, clears the composer, and publishes the created thread.
- Existing explicit `New Thread` behavior continues to work.
- The composer visibly carries compact project/branch, permission, and model
  context so it reads as the task control center rather than a plain textarea.
- `Enter` send and `Shift+Enter` newline behavior are preserved.

Verification:

- Unit/component test command:
  `cd packages/desktop && SHELL=/bin/bash npx vitest run src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- Build/typecheck/lint commands:
  `cd packages/desktop && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build`
- Real Electron harness:
  `cd packages/desktop && npm run e2e:cdp`
- Harness path: `packages/desktop/scripts/e2e-cdp-smoke.mjs`
- E2E scenario steps: launch real Electron with isolated HOME/runtime/user-data
  and fake ACP, open the fake Git project, type a prompt into the project-scoped
  composer without clicking `New Thread`, send it, approve the fake command
  request, and assert the created thread/message/response appear.
- E2E assertions: first viewport landmarks stay present; composer is enabled
  after project open; no `New Thread` click is required; fake ACP response is
  received; console errors and failed local requests are absent.
- Diagnostic artifacts: CDP screenshots, layout JSON, DOM text, Electron log,
  summary JSON under `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/artifacts/`.
- Required skills applied: `frontend-design` for composer layout/control
  hierarchy with the prototype as the strict visual contract; `electron-desktop-dev`
  for renderer changes and real Electron CDP verification.

Notes and decisions:

- The prototype wins over earlier tab/dashboard guidance. This slice keeps the
  conversation as the default surface and upgrades the bottom composer without
  opening review, terminal, or settings by default.
- Model and permission controls are compact context controls in the composer.
  They use existing session runtime state when available and safe fallback
  labels before a session exists; changing values still requires a live session
  until the server API supports project-level defaults.
- Implementation changed first-send behavior so any active project with no
  active session creates a session on submit. The explicit `New Thread` button
  still creates a draft thread for users who want to start intentionally from
  the sidebar.
- CDP smoke now sends the first prompt immediately after opening the fake
  project and before clicking `Changes`, proving the `New Thread` click is no
  longer required.

Verification results:

- `cd packages/desktop && SHELL=/bin/bash npx vitest run src/renderer/components/layout/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`
  passed with 4 tests.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run typecheck` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run lint` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run build` passed.
- `cd packages/desktop && npm run e2e:cdp` passed.
- Passing artifacts:
  `.qwen/e2e-tests/electron-desktop/artifacts/2026-04-25T16-41-09-752Z/`.

Next work:

- Continue prototype fidelity by reducing topbar tab weight and moving review
  access toward compact icon/drawer behavior.
- Follow-up model configuration work should make composer model/permission
  controls editable before a session exists by persisting project-level
  defaults, rather than only reflecting live session runtime state.
