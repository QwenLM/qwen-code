feat(cli): Stabilize CLI and harden development workflow

This commit addresses a series of cascading `ReferenceError` bugs that were causing the `qwen` CLI to crash on startup and exit. The root cause was an incomplete refactoring of the slash command logic.

The following fixes have been implemented:
- Corrected all remaining instances of the `slashCommands` variable to `commands`.
- Ensured the `useCallback` hook for the exit handler has the correct dependencies.
- Replaced a call to a non-existent `isSlashCommand` function with the correct `isCommand` utility.

To prevent similar issues in the future, this commit also introduces a more robust development workflow:
- Adds `husky` to the project.
- Configures a `pre-commit` hook to run `npm run lint`, which will automatically catch common errors and enforce code quality before they can be committed.
