# /loop — schedule a recurring prompt

## Subcommands

If the input (after stripping the `/loop` prefix) is exactly one of these keywords, run the subcommand instead of scheduling:

- **`list`** — call CronList and display the results. Done.
- **`clear`** — call CronList, then call CronDelete for every job returned. Confirm how many were cancelled. Done.

Otherwise, parse the input below into `[interval] <prompt…>` and schedule it with CronCreate.

## Parsing (in priority order)

1. **Leading token**: if the first whitespace-delimited token matches `^\d+[smhd]$` (e.g. `5m`, `2h`), that's the interval; the rest is the prompt.
2. **Trailing "every" clause**: otherwise, if the input ends with `every <N><unit>` or `every <N> <unit-word>` (e.g. `every 20m`, `every 5 minutes`, `every 2 hours`), extract that as the interval and strip it from the prompt. Only match when what follows "every" is a time expression — `check every PR` has no interval.
3. **Default**: otherwise, interval is `10m` and the entire input is the prompt.

If the resulting prompt is empty, show usage `/loop [interval] <prompt>` and stop — do not call CronCreate.

Examples:

- `5m /babysit-prs` → interval `5m`, prompt `/babysit-prs` (rule 1)
- `check the deploy every 20m` → interval `20m`, prompt `check the deploy` (rule 2)
- `run tests every 5 minutes` → interval `5m`, prompt `run tests` (rule 2)
- `check the deploy` → interval `10m`, prompt `check the deploy` (rule 3)
- `check every PR` → interval `10m`, prompt `check every PR` (rule 3 — "every" not followed by time)
- `5m` → empty prompt → show usage

## Interval → cron

Supported suffixes: `s` (seconds, rounded up to nearest minute, min 1), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). Convert:

| Interval pattern  | Cron expression        | Notes                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Nm` where N ≤ 59 | `*/N * * * *`          | every N minutes                           |
| `Nm` where N ≥ 60 | `0 */H * * *`          | round to hours (H = N/60, must divide 24) |
| `Nh` where N ≤ 23 | `0 */N * * *`          | every N hours                             |
| `Nd`              | `0 0 */N * *`          | every N days at midnight local            |
| `Ns`              | treat as `ceil(N/60)m` | cron minimum granularity is 1 minute      |

**If the interval doesn't cleanly divide its unit** (e.g. `7m` → `*/7 * * * *` gives uneven gaps at :56→:00; `90m` → 1.5h which cron can't express), pick the nearest clean interval and tell the user what you rounded to before scheduling.

## Action

1. Call CronCreate with:
   - `cron`: the expression from the table above
   - `prompt`: the parsed prompt from above, verbatim (slash commands are passed through unchanged)
   - `recurring`: `true`
2. Briefly confirm: what's scheduled, the cron expression, the human-readable cadence, that recurring tasks auto-expire after 3 days, and that they can cancel sooner with CronDelete (include the job ID).
3. **Then immediately execute the parsed prompt now** — don't wait for the first cron fire. If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.
