// Post-review cleanup for /review Step 9.
//   - Remove the temporary worktree at .qwen/tmp/review-pr-<n>.
//   - Delete the local branch ref qwen-review/pr-<n>.
//   - Remove any .qwen/tmp/qwen-review-<target>-* side files.
//
// The command is idempotent — missing files / branches are silent OK.
