// Coverage, computed from the harness's records rather than accepted from the
// caller.
//
// This is shared by `check-coverage` (which stops the run) and `compose-review`
// (which caps the verdict) deliberately. The old shape had `check-coverage` write
// a report and `compose-review` take a `coverage` **field in a JSON the model
// writes** — so hardening the first while the second still believed a hand-typed
// `{"ok": true}` would have moved the forgery one hop downstream and made it
// cheaper: one object instead of eighteen fabricated receipts. A caller cannot
// forge what it cannot supply, so neither of them is given the answer. They both
// derive it.
//
// **What a chunk being "covered" means here, and what it used to mean.** The
// first version asked one question of the transcript: did an agent whose launch
// prompt said `chunk 3 of 18` make at least one successful tool call? That model
// had two holes, and dogfooding walked into both.
//
//   - It could only see a **territory agent**. Step 3B assigns one agent per chunk
//     and their prompts say so; Step 3A — the topology *most* pull requests get,
//     and which the skill explicitly says has no receipts — assigns every dimension
//     agent the whole diff, and no agent's prompt names a chunk. Run against a real
//     Step 3A review in which fifteen agents each opened the diff, walked both
//     chunks and filed findings, this file returned `0/2 chunk(s) reviewed …
//     Nobody read those lines` — in the same breath as `16 agent(s) ran; 16 did
//     work`. `compose-review` runs the same computation on the way to the verdict,
//     so a flawless small-PR review was capped away from Approve and told, in the
//     body it would have posted to the pull request, that nobody had read it. Both
//     sentences cannot be true. The false one is the one this file wrote.
//
//   - It credited **any** successful tool call. A `glob` for test files is a
//     successful tool call. What a review has to be able to say is not that an
//     agent did something, but that someone opened the lines it is about to
//     certify.
//
// So coverage is no longer a claim an agent makes about a chunk. It is the
// intersection of two things the harness wrote down: the **lines the agent was
// pointed at** (its launch prompt, recorded at launch, before the model spoke) and
// the fact that it **opened the diff** (a successful tool call whose arguments
// named the diff file). Both are topology-blind. A territory agent is pointed at
// one chunk; a Step 3A dimension agent is pointed at all of them; a reverse-audit
// agent is pointed at none, and is credited only with the ranges it demonstrably
// read.
//
// What this proves, and what it does not: that an agent was given the lines and
// opened the file. Not that it read every byte — no check can, and pretending
// otherwise is how the receipts became theatre. The paging rule is what covers the
// rest, and it is now in the prompt, in code.
