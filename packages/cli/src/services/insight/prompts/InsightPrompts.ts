export const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `Analyze this Qwen Code session and extract structured facets.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **goal_categories**: Count ONLY what the USER explicitly asked for.
   - DO NOT count Qwen's autonomous codebase exploration
   - DO NOT count work Qwen decided to do on its own
   - ONLY count when user says "can you...", "please...", "I need...", "let's...
   - POSSIBLE CATEGORIES (but be open to others that appear in the data):
      - bug_fix
      - feature_request
      - debugging
      - test_creation
      - code_refactoring
      - documentation_update
   "

2. **user_satisfaction_counts**: Base ONLY on explicit user signals.
   - "Yay!", "great!", "perfect!" → happy
   - "thanks", "looks good", "that works" → satisfied
   - "ok, now let's..." (continuing without complaint) → likely_satisfied
   - "that's not right", "try again" → dissatisfied
   - "this is broken", "I give up" → frustrated

3. **friction_counts**: Be specific about what went wrong.
   - misunderstood_request: Qwen interpreted incorrectly
   - wrong_approach: Right goal, wrong solution method
   - buggy_code: Code didn't work correctly
   - user_rejected_action: User said no/stop to a tool call
   - excessive_changes: Over-engineered or changed too much

4. If very short or just warmup, use warmup_minimal for goal_category`;

## QC FEATURES REFERENCE (pick from these for features_to_try):
1. **MCP Servers**: Connect Qwen to external tools, databases, and APIs via Model Context Protocol.
   - How to use: Run \`qwen mcp add --transport http <server-name> <http-url>\`
   - Good for: database queries, Slack integration, GitHub issue lookup, connecting to internal APIs

2. **Custom Skills**: Reusable prompts you define as markdown files that run with a single /command.
   - How to use: Create \`.qwen/skills/commit/SKILL.md\` with instructions. Then type \`/commit\` to run it.
   - Good for: repetitive workflows - /commit, /review, /test, /deploy, /pr, or complex multi-step workflows

3. **Headless Mode**: Run Qwen non-interactively from scripts and CI/CD.
   - How to use: \`qwen -p "fix lint errors"\`
   - Good for: CI/CD integration, batch code fixes, automated reviews

4. **Task Agents**: Qwen spawns focused sub-agents for complex exploration or parallel work.
   - How to use: Qwen auto-invokes when helpful, or ask "use an agent to explore X"
   - Good for: codebase exploration, understanding complex systems

Call respond_in_schema function with A VALID JSON OBJECT as argument:
{
  "Qwen_md_additions": [
    {"addition": "A specific line or block to add to QWEN.md based on workflow patterns. E.g., 'Always run tests after modifying auth-related files'", "why": "1 sentence explaining why this would help based on actual sessions", "prompt_scaffold": "Instructions for where to add this in QWEN.md. E.g., 'Add under ## Testing section'"}
  ],
  "features_to_try": [
    {"feature": "Feature name from QC FEATURES REFERENCE above", "one_liner": "What it does", "why_for_you": "Why this would help YOU based on your sessions", "example_code": "Actual command or config to copy"}

    {"title": "Short title", "suggestion": "1-2 sentence summary", "detail": "3-4 sentences explaining how this applies to YOUR work", "copyable_prompt": "A specific prompt to copy and try"}
  ]
}

IMPORTANT for Qwen_md_additions: PRIORITIZE instructions that appear MULTIPLE TIMES in the user data. If user told Qwen the same thing in 2+ sessions (e.g., 'always run tests', 'use TypeScript'), that's a PRIME candidate - they shouldn't have to repeat themselves.

IMPORTANT for features_to_try: Pick 2-3 from the QC FEATURES REFERENCE above. Include 2-3 items for each category.`;

export const PROMPT_INTERACTION_STYLE = `Analyze this Qwen Code usage data and describe the user's interaction style.

Call respond_in_schema function with A VALID JSON OBJECT as argument:
{
  "narrative": "2-3 paragraphs analyzing HOW the user interacts with Qwen Code. Use second person 'you'. Describe patterns: iterate quickly vs detailed upfront specs? Interrupt often or let Qwen run? Include specific examples. Use **bold** for key insights.",
  "key_pattern": "One sentence summary of most distinctive interaction style"
}
`;

export const PROMPT_AT_A_GLANCE = `You're writing an "At a Glance" summary for a Qwen Code usage insights report for Qwen Code users. The goal is to help them understand their usage and improve how they can use Qwen better, especially as models improve.

Use this 4-part structure:

1. **What's working** - What is the user's unique style of interacting with Qwen and what are some impactful things they've done? You can include one or two details, but keep it high level since things might not be fresh in the user's memory. Don't be fluffy or overly complimentary. Also, don't focus on the tool calls they use.

2. **What's hindering you** - Split into (a) Qwen's fault (misunderstandings, wrong approaches, bugs) and (b) user-side friction (not providing enough context, environment issues -- ideally more general than just one project). Be honest but constructive.

3. **Quick wins to try** - Specific Qwen Code features they could try from the examples below, or a workflow technique if you think it's really compelling. (Avoid stuff like "Ask Qwen to confirm before taking actions" or "Type out more context up front" which are less compelling.)

4. **Ambitious workflows for better models** - As we move to much more capable models over the next 3-6 months, what should they prepare for? What workflows that seem impossible now will become possible? Draw from the appropriate section below.

Keep each section to 2-3 not-too-long sentences. Don't overwhelm the user. Don't mention specific numerical stats or underlined_categories from the session data below. Use a coaching tone.

Call respond_in_schema function with A VALID JSON OBJECT as argument:
{
  "whats_working": "(refer to instructions above)",
  "whats_hindering": "(refer to instructions above)",
  "quick_wins": "(refer to instructions above)",
  "ambitious_workflows": "(refer to instructions above)"
}`;
