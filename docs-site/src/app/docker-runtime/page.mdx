# Docker sandbox runtime

## Why Java is not available by default

The official Qwen Code Docker image is intentionally minimal to keep the image
small, secure, and fast to pull.

Different users require different language runtimes (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.),
and bundling all environments into a single image is not practical.

Therefore, Java is **not included by default** in the Docker sandbox.

## How to add Java to the Docker sandbox

If your workflow requires Java, you can extend the base image with your own
dependencies. For example:

```dockerfile
FROM qwenlm/qwen-code:latest

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jre && \
    apt-get clean
